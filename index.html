    We employ commercially reasonable and industry-standard security measures to prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy and ensure proper use of information we receive.  

    These security measures are both electronic as well as physical but at the same time no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  

    We strive to protect the User Information, although we cannot ensure the security of Information furnished/transmitted by the users to us.  

    We recommend you not to disclose the password of your email address, online bank transaction and other important credentials to our employees / agents / affiliates/ personnel, as we do not ask for the same.  

    <br><br>
    We recommend that registered users not share their application’s account password and also to sign out of their account when they have completed their work. This is to ensure that others cannot access Information of the users and correspondence, if the user shares the computer with someone else or is using a computer in a public place
